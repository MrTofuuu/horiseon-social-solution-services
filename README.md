# horiseon-social-solution-services
This is a landing page for Horiseon, a social solution services company



## Description
The current code for Horiseon does not follow HTML semantics and has some repeating/redundant CSS selectors. I will refactor the code and keep the same formatting of the existing code. The website is also missing alt tags which I will add so that the website will show up higher for SEO. The link for "Search Engine Optimization" is not working, will fix it so that the link is properly navigating to the proper id.


### **Tasks completed**

1. Formated the HTMl to follow HTML semantics. **Example of change below** 

            Before
            <div class="#">

            After
            <section class="#">

2. Consolidated CSS selectors that were creating a class for an existing element and calling the class. **Example of change** (In HTML: < changed to In HTML: )
            
            Before
            <header class="header">

            After
            <header>

3. Fixed heading attributes to be used in sequential order

4. Added a more detailed title compared to "website"
